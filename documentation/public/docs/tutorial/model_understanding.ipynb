    "## What is model understanding?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model understanding** or **model interpretation** aims to explain models. Those methods can be used to identify modeling and data issues, and to improve decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model understanding** is different from **prediction understanding** which aims to explain one model prediction. To explain predictions, see the [prediction understanding](../prediction_understanding) tutorial instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In YDF, model understanding can be done in 3 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  `model.describe`: This method shows the input features of the models, variable importances, training logs, individual trees, and other model specific information.\n",
    "- `model.analyze`: This method runs and displays a deep analysis of the model on a given dataset. For instance, this method shows more variable importances (including SHAP values) and partial dependence plots. \n",
    "- `model.print_tree()` and `model.plot_tree()`: Those methods print/plot the actual decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** While you can look at the decision trees individually, it is not a good way to interpret models unless your model only contains a single tree. For models with multiple trees like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees, using other methods (notably `model.analyze`) is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information:** Counter-factual analysis is a complementary and more complex way to understand a model. See the [counterfactual notebook](../counterfactual) for details."

    "## Model description\n",
    "\n",
    "The **model description** contains two key pieces of information for understanding the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable importances**: Variable importances show which features are most important to the model. A variable with a high score is more useful for the model to make its predictions than a variable with a low score.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist different measures of variable importances. For instance, the \"num_nodes\" indicates how many of the nodes in the decision trees use a particular feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of variable importance is \"mean {decrease,increase} in [metric name]\". These show how much the quality of the model would decrease if the feature were removed (in practice, removing a feature is expensive, so the feature is shuffled instead).\n",
    "For example, a feature with a \"mean decrease in accuracy\" of 0.1 means that removing this feature would reduce the accuracy of the model by ~0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable importances measures shown by YDF complement each other; no single measure can give a full understanding of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**: Decision forest models are made up of decision trees. The *structure* tab of the model description shows the first decision tree in the model. This can be helpful for understanding how the model is making predictions in general.\n"

    "To maximize the quality of your predictions, you likely trained a random forest or a gradient-boosted trees model. While these models are powerful, they can be hard to interpret. For example, only the first tree in a gradient-boosted tree is easily interpretable. To understand these complex models, you can train a simpler model that exhibits similar behavior but with lower performance and easier interpretability. A decision tree, for instance, is a weaker model with a simpler tree structure that can provide valuable insights."
