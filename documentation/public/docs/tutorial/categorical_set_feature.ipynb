        "\n",
        "A categorical-set feature is a type of input feature where each value is a set (i.e., a list of non-ordered) categorical values. They differ from classical categorical feature where each value is a single categorical value.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Why using categorical-set features?\n",
        "\n",
        "Categorical-set features are useful for tags-like or tokenizable features like text and URLs, especially with small datasets.\n",
        "For example, the text feature value \"I eat an applepie!\" becomes the categorical-set feature value {\"I\", \"eat\", \"an\", \"applepie!\"} using whitespace splitting uni-gram tokenization. Bi-gram or tri-gram tokenization can also be used and sometimes give good results. For example, the same text becomes {\"I_eat\", \"eat_an\", \"an_applepie!\"} with bigrams.\n",
        "\n",
        "While simple, whitespace splitting does not works with punctuation and with some languages.\n",
        "If possible, prefer modern tokenizers such as [Google's Sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) or [OpenAI's Tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken), or [Transformer tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.0.2/model_doc/gpt2.html#gpt2tokenizer).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will use tiktoken with the \"r50k_base\" configuration used by GPT-2 and some GPT-3 models.\n",
        "For example, the text above will become: [\"I\", \"_eat\", \"_an\", \"_apple\", \"pie\", \"_!\"]"
